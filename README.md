# Compiler UI using Java
This is a readme file about the User Interface (UI) for a compiler using Java. The UI consists of various buttons and a text area to display the source code and the results of the compilation process.

Features:
Open File button: This button allows you to open a file containing your source code. You can choose a .java file to open.

Lexical Analysis button: This button starts the lexical analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

Syntax Analysis button: This button starts the syntax analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

Semantic Analysis button: This button starts the semantic analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

Clear button: This button clears the contents of the Result Text area.

Result Text area: This is a text area where the results of the compilation process are displayed.

Source Code area: This is a text area where the source code is displayed.

Prerequisites:
JDK (Java Development Kit) should be installed on your system.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA is recommended.
Getting Started:
Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
In the src folder of your project, create a new package.
Inside the package, create a new class for the compiler UI.
Import the necessary libraries for the UI components (e.g., javax.swing).
Implement the functionality of the buttons and text areas in the class.
Create a new class with a main method to run the application.
Compile and run the application.
For detailed information on implementing the UI, you can refer to the Java documentation or search for online tutorials on creating GUI applications in Java.
