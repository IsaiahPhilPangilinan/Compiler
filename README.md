As computer science students embarking on the journey of compiler construction, we often encounter complex interfaces and opaque error messages. This can hinder our understanding of the compilation process and impede our learning. To address this challenge, we present our user interface (UI) design for a compiler specifically tailored for beginners.

1. Open File button: This button allows you to open a file containing your source code. You can choose a .txt file to open.

2. Lexical Analysis button: This button starts the lexical analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

3. Syntax Analysis button: This button starts the syntax analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

4. Semantic Analysis button: This button starts the semantic analysis process of the source code. The results of this process will be displayed in the Result Text area.

5. Clear button: This button clears the contents of the Result Text area.

6. Result Text area: This is a text area where the results of the compilation process are displayed.

7. Source Code area: This is a text area where the source code is displayed.

1. JDK (Java Development Kit) should be installed on your system. (Click the image to download)

2. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA is recommended. (Click the image to download)

## Getting Started:
1. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
2. In the src folder of your project, create a new package.
3. Inside the package, create a new class for the compiler UI.
4. Import the necessary libraries for the UI components (e.g., javax.swing).
5. Implement the functionality of the buttons and text areas in the class.
6. Create a new class with a main method to run the application.
7. Compile and run the application.
